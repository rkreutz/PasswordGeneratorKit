As the name implies, this is a Swift Package that generates passwords pseudo-randomically deriving from a master password and some other inputs.

## Usage

To use a `PasswordGenerator` you must specify a `MasterPasswordProvider`, which will be responsible for providing the master password from which the final password will be generated from. `String` by default conforms to `MasterPasswordProvider` by returning itself as the master password. You may optionally provide some extra configuration related to the entropy generator: you may use a PBKDF2 based entropy generator, providing an optional amount of iterations; or you may use a Argon2 based entropy generator, providing optional iterations, memory cost and threads. Both entropy generators support also the amount of bytes that should be generated.

```swift
let passwordGenerator = PasswordGenerator(
    masterPasswordProvider: "masterPassword",
    entropyGenerator: .pbkdf2(iterations: 1_000),
    bytes: 24
)

// OR

let passwordGenerator = PasswordGenerator(
    masterPasswordProvider: "masterPassword",
    entropyGenerator: .argon2(iterations: 3, memory: 16_384, threads: 1),
    bytes: 24
)
```

With the created password generator you can generate passwords through the provided methods which expects some inputs that will be used as a `salt` on the underlying entropy generator.

```swift
// Generates a password using a salt based on an username (email, username, ...), domain (website domain) and seed (user defined number).
func generatePassword(username: String, domain: String, seed: Int, rules: Set<PasswordRule>) throws -> String

// Generates a password using a salt based on a service (Bank account, card pin, ...)
func generatePassword(service: String, rules: Set<PasswordRule>) throws -> String

// Generates a password using the provided salt
func generatePassword(salt: String, rules: Set<PasswordRule>) throws -> String
```

All the methods expect a `Set` of `PasswordRule`s:

```swift
enum PasswordRule {

    // Specifies that the generated password must contain a minimum number of characters in the provided character set
    case mustContain(characterSet: String, atLeast: UInt)
    
    // The length of the generated password
    case length(UInt)
}
```

Have in mind that the `Set<PasswordRule>` must contain a `.length` case and at least one `.mustContain` case.

You may use `PasswordRule.defaultRules` which comprimises a union of `PasswordRule.defaultCharacterSet` (minimum of 1 special character, decimal character, uppercase character and lowercase character) and `PasswordRule.defaultLength` (length of 16 characters).

In the end you would have something like this:
```swift
let generator = PasswordGenerator(masterPasswordProvider: "masterPassword")

let generatedPassword = try generator.generatePassword(
    username: "rkreutz",
    domain: "github.com",
    seed: 1,
    rules: PasswordRule.defaultRules
)

print(generatedPassword) // L5bnoSNxy5OZ_6LE     -> Don't even bother this is not my password ðŸ˜‚
```

**Some caveats:**
- You can further tweak the entropy generators so they take less or more time to generate entropy. The longer it takes, the better it is on a security level perspective, but at the same time it degrades user experience.
- The number of `bytes` will affect how many characters the password generator will be able to randomize before starting to repeat itself (entropy), so if you get to a point where the generated password has several trailing characters that are the same, most likely you need more bytes being generated by your entropy source. 24 _should_ be enough for up to 32 characters long passwords.

## CLI

There is a CLI for using the password generator, you can easily download it from the latest Release or compile it locally with:
```bash
swift build --configuration release
```
